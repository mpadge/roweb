A new rOpenSci package provides access to data to which users may already have
directly contributed, and for which contribution is fun, keeps you fit, and
[helps made the world a better place](http://www.bmj.com/content/357/bmj.j1456). 
The data come from using public bicycle hire schemes, and the package is called
[`bikedata`](https://github.com/ropensci/bikedata).  Public bicycle hire systems
operate in many cities throughout the world, and most systems collect (generally
anonymous) data, minimally consisting of the times and locations at which every
single bicycle trip starts and ends. The
[`bikedata`](https://github.com/ropensci/bikedata) package provides access to
data from all cities which openly publish these data, currently including
[London, U.K.](https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/cycling/santander-cycles), and in the
U.S.A., [New York](https://www.citibikenyc.com), [Los
Angeles](https://bikeshare.metro.net),
[Philadelphia](https://www.rideindego.com),
[Chicago](https://www.divvybikes.com), [Boston](https://www.thehubway.com), and
[Washington DC](https://www.capitalbikeshare.com).  The package will expand as
more cities openly publish their data (with the newly enormously expanded San
Francisco system [next on the
list](https://github.com/ropensci/bikedata/issues/2)).


# Why bikedata?

The short answer to that question is that the package provides access to what is
arguably one of the most spatially and temporally detailed databases of
finely-scaled human movement throughout several of the world's most important
cities. Such data are likely to prove invaluable in the increasingly active and
well-funded attempt to develop a science of cities. Such a science does not yet
exist in any way comparable to most other well-established scientific
disciplines, but the importance of developing a science of cities is
indisputable, and reflected in such enterprises as the NYU-based [Center for
Urban Science and Progress](http://cusp.nyu.edu), or the UCL-based [Centre for
Advanced Spatial Analysis](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/casa/).

People move through cities, yet at present anyone faced with the seemingly
fundamental question of how, when, and where people do so would likely have to
draw on some form of private data (typically operators of transport systems or
mobile phone providers). There are very few open, public data providing insight
into this question.  The [`bikedata`](https://github.com/ropensci/bikedata)
package aims to be one contribution towards filling this gap.  The data accessed
by the package are entirely open, and are constantly updated, typically on a
monthly basis. The package thus provides ongoing insight into the dynamic
changes and reconfigurations of these cities.  Data currently available via the
package amounts to several tens of Gigabytes, and will expand rapidly both with
time, and with the inclusion of more cities.


## Why are these data published?

In answer to that question, all credit must rightfully go to [Adrian
Short](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/01/11/transport_for_london_foi/), who
submitted a Freedom of Information request in 2011 to Transport for London for
usage statistics from the relatively new, and largely publicly-funded, bicycle
scheme.  This request from one individual ultimately resulted in the data being
openly published on an ongoing basis. All U.S. systems included in
[`bikedata`](https://github.com/ropensci/bikedata) commenced operation
subsequent to that point in time, and many of them have openly published their
data from the very beginning.  The majority of the world's public bicycle hire
systems ([see list
here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_bicycle-sharing_systems))
nevertheless do not openly publish data, notably including very large systems in
China, France, and Spain.  One important aspiration of the
[`bikedata`](https://github.com/ropensci/bikedata) package is to demonstrate the
positive benefit for the cities themselves of openly and easily facilitating
complex analyses of usage data, which brings us to ...

## What's important about these data?

As mentioned, the data really do provide uniquely valuable insights into the
movement patterns and behaviour of people within some of the world's major
cities. While the more detailed explorations below demonstrate the kinds of
things that can be done with the package, the variety of insights these data
facilitate is best demonstrated through considering the work of other people,
exemplified by [Todd Schneider's high-profile blog
piece](http://toddwschneider.com/posts/a-tale-of-twenty-two-million-citi-bikes-analyzing-the-nyc-bike-share-system/)
on the New York City system.  Todd's analyses clearly demonstrate how these data
can provide insight into where and when people move, into inter-relationships
between various forms of transport, and into relationships with broader
environmental factors such as weather. As cities evolve, and public bicycle hire
schemes along with them, data from these systems can play a vital role in
informing and guiding the ongoing processes of urban development.  The
[`bikedata`](https://github.com/ropensci/bikedata) package greatly facilitates
analysing such processes, not only through making data access and aggregation
enormously easier, but through enabling analyses from any one system to be
immediately applied to, and compared with, any other systems.

# How it works

The package currently focusses on the data alone, and provides functionality for
downloading, storage, and aggregation. The data are stored in an `SQLite3`
database, enabling newly published data to be continually added, generally with
one simple line of code. It's as easy as:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
store_bikedata (city = "chicago", bikedb = "bikedb")
```
If the nominated database (`bikedb`) already holds data for Chicago, only new
data will be added, otherwise all historical data will be downloaded and added.
All bicycle hire systems accessed by `bikedata` have fixed docking stations, and
the primary means of aggregation is in terms of "trip matrices", which are
square matrices of numbers of trips between all pairs of stations, extracted
with:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
tm <- bike_tripmat (bikedb = "bikedb", city = "chi")
```
Note that most parameters are highly flexible in terms of formatting, so pretty
much anything starting with `"ch"` will be recognised as Chicago. Of course, if
the database only contains data for Chicago, the `city` parameter may be omitted
entirely. Trip matrices may be filtered by time, through combinations of year,
month, day, hour, minute, or even second, as well as by demographic
characteristics such as gender or date of birth for those systems which provide
such data. (These latter data are freely provided by users of the systems, and
there can be no guarantee of their accuracy.) These can all be combined in calls
like the following, which further demonstrates the highly flexible ways of
specifying the various parameters:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
tm <- bike_tripmat ("bikedb", city = "london, innit",
                    start_date = 20160101, end_date = "16,02,28",
                    start_time = 6, end_time = 24,
                    birth_year = 1980:1990, gender = "f")
```
The second mode of aggregation is as daily time series, via the
`bike_daily_trips()` function. See [the
vignette](https://ropensci.github.io/bikedata/articles/bikedata.html) for
further details.

# What can be done with these data?

Lots of things. How about examining how far people ride. This requires getting
the distances between all pairs of docking stations as routed through the street
network, to yield a distance matrix corresponding to the trip matrix.
Fortunately, a new R package has just been released to perform exactly that
task. It's called [`dodgr`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=dodgr) (Distances
on Directed Graphs). (Disclaimer: It's my package, and this is a shameless plug
for it - please use it!) Calculating distance matrices is as easy as,
```{r, eval = FALSE}
library (dodgr)
stns <- bike_stations ("bikedb", city = "chicago")
xy <- stns [, which (names (stns) %in% c ("longitude", "latitude", "stn_id"))]
dmat <- dodgr_dists (from = xy, to = xy, quiet = FALSE)
```
```{r, echo = FALSE}
message (paste0 ("No graph submitted to dodgr_dists; ",
                 "downloading street network ...  done\n",
                 "Converting network to dodgr graph ... done\n",
                 "Calculating shortest paths ... done."))
```
This function may take a minute or two to execute, mostly because it works by
first downloading the entire street network encompassing those stations (using
the rOpenSci package `osmdata`). The actual routing throughout the network is
relatively quick.  Including the `stn_id` columns in `xy` ensures that the rows
and columns of `dmat` will be labelled by the station ID. These enable the
distance matrix to be matched to the trip matrix, which is necessary because the
latter may not include all stations listed by a given system. Trip matrices may
be extracted as demonstrated above with the `bike_tripmat()` function.  The rows
and columns of the two matrices can be matched with the following simple
function:
```{r}
match_mats <- function (dmat, tmat)
{
    nms <- intersect (rownames (tmat), rownames (dmat))
    index <- match (nms, rownames (tmat))
    tmat <- tmat [index, index]
    index <- match (nms, rownames (dmat))
    dmat <- dmat [index, index]
    list (tmat = tmat, dmat = dmat)
}
```
Distances can then be visually related to trip numbers to reveal their
distributional form. These matrices contain too many values to plot directly, so
the `hexbin` package is used here to aggregate in a `ggplot`.
```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
mats <- match_mats (dmat, tmat)
dmat <- mats$dmat
tmat <- mats$tmat

library (hexbin)
library (ggplot2)
dat <- data.frame (distance = as.vector (dmat),
                   number = as.vector (tmat))
ggplot (dat, aes (x = distance, y = number)) +
    stat_binhex(aes(fill = log (..count..))) +
    scale_x_log10 (breaks = c (0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20),
                   labels = c ("0.1", "0.5", "1", "2", "5", "10", "20")) +
    scale_y_log10 (breaks = c (10, 100, 1000)) +
    scale_fill_gradientn(colours = c("seagreen","goldenrod1"),
                         name = "Frequency", na.value = NA) +
    guides (fill = FALSE) +
    theme (axis.title = element_text (size = 4),
           axis.text = element_text (size = 4))
ggsave (file = "chicago.png", width = 2, height = 2, units = "in")
```
```{r, eval = FALSE}
library (hexbin)
library (ggplot2)
dat <- data.frame (distance = as.vector (dmat),
                   number = as.vector (tmat))
ggplot (dat, aes (x = distance, y = number)) +
    stat_binhex(aes(fill = log (..count..))) +
    scale_x_log10 (breaks = c (0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20),
                   labels = c ("0.1", "0.5", "1", "2", "5", "10", "20")) +
    scale_y_log10 (breaks = c (10, 100, 1000)) +
    scale_fill_gradientn(colours = c("seagreen","goldenrod1"),
                         name = "Frequency", na.value = NA) +
    guides (fill = FALSE)
```

The central region of the graph (yellow hexagons) reveals that numbers of trips
generally decrease roughly exponentially with increasing distance (noting that
scales are logarithmic), with most trip distances lying below 5km.  What is the
"average" distance travelled in Chicago? The easiest way to calculate this is
as a weighted mean,
```{r, eval = FALSE}
sum (as.vector (dmat) * as.vector (tmat) / sum (tmat), na.rm = TRUE)
```
```{r, echo = FALSE}
2.510285
```
giving a value of just over 2.5 kilometres.  We could also compare differences
in mean distances between cyclists who are registered with a system and causal
users. These two categories may be loosely considered to reflect "residents" and
"non-residents".  Let's wrap this in a function so we can use it for even cooler
stuff in a moment.
```{r, eval = FALSE}
dmean <- function (bikedb = "bikedb", city = "chicago")
{
    tm <- bike_tripmat (bikedb = bikedb, city = city)
    tm_memb <- bike_tripmat (bikedb = bikedb, city = city, member = TRUE)
    tm_nomemb <- bike_tripmat (bikedb = bikedb, city = city, member = FALSE)
    stns <- bike_stations (bikedb = bikedb, city = city)

    xy <- stns [, which (names (stns) %in% c ("longitude", "latitude", "stn_id"))]
    dm <- dodgr_dists (from = xy, to = xy, quiet = FALSE)

    tm_memb <- match_mats (dm, tm_memb)$tmat
    tm_nomemb <- match_mats (dm, tm_nomemb)$tmat
    mats <- match_mats (dm, tm)
    dm <- mats$dmat
    tm <- mats$tmat

    d0 <- sum (as.vector (dm) * as.vector (tm) / sum (tm), na.rm = TRUE)
    dmemb <- sum (as.vector (dm) * as.vector (tmemb) / sum (t_memb), na.rm = TRUE)
    dnomemb <- sum (as.vector (dm) * as.vector (tm_nomemb) / sum (tm_nomemb), na.rm = TRUE)
    res <- c (d0, dmemb / dnomemb)
    names (res) <- c ("dmean", "ratio_memb_non")
    return (res)
}
```
Differences in distances ridden between "resident" and "non-resident" cyclists
can then be calculated with
```{r, eval = FALSE}
dmean (bikedb = bikedb, city = "ch")
```
```{r, echo = FALSE}
x <- c (2.510698, 1.023225)
names (x) <- c ("dmean", "ratio_memb_non")
x
```
And system members cycle slightly longer distances than non-members. (Do not at
this point ask about statistical tests - these comparisons are made between
millions--often tens of millions--of points, and statistical significance may
always be assumed to be negligibly small.) Whatever the reason for this
difference between "residents" and others, we can use this exact same code to
compare equivalent distances for all cities which record whether users are
members or not (which is all cities except London and Washington DC).
```{r, eval = FALSE}
cities <- c ("ny", "ch", "bo", "la", "ph") # NYC, Chicago, Boston, LA, Philadelphia
sapply (cities, function (i) dmean (bikedb = bikedb, city = i))
```
```{r, echo = FALSE}
library (ggplot2)
cities <-  c ("ny", "ch", "bo", "la", "ph")
dmean <- c (2.8519131, 2.510285, 2.153918, 2.156919, 1.702372)
ratio_memb_non <- c (0.9833729, 1.023385, 1.000635, 1.360099, 1.130929)
res <- rbind (dmean, ratio_memb_non)
colnames (res) <- cities
res
```
And we thus discover that Boston manifests the greatest equality
in terms of distances cycled between residents and non-residents, while LA
manifests the greatest difference. New York City is the only one of these five
in which non-members of the system actually cycle further than members.  (And
note that these two measures can't be statistically compared in any direct way,
because mean distances are also affected by relative numbers of member to
non-member trips.) These results likely reflect a host of (scientifically)
interesting cultural and geo-spatial differences between these cities, and
demonstrate how the `bikedata` package (combined with `dodgr` and `osmdata`) can
provide unique insight into differences in human behaviour between some of the
most important cities in the U.S.

# visualisation

Many users are likely to want to visualise how people use a given bicycle
system, and in particular are likely to want to produce maps. This is readily
done in conjunction with the rOpenSci packages
[`osmdata`](https://github.com/ropensci/osmdata) for the street network and
[`stplanr`](https://github.com/ropensci/stplanr) for mapping trip densities onto
the network, as illustrated at the end of the [`bikedata`
vignette](https://ropensci.github.io/bikedata/articles/bikedata.html#visualisation-of-bicycle-trips),
which details the code necessary to produce this map of usage of the Los Angeles
system:

<!--- ![](/assets/blog-images/2017-10-17-bikedata/la.png) --->
![](la.png)

The code to produce this map is, however, rather protracted, and relies on a
variety of arguably outdated code required to interface with other packages.
Plans are afoot to make such plotting much easier, and to incorporate it
directly within the [`bikedata` package](https://github.com/ropensci/bikedata),
which brings us to the penultimate point of ...

# What could be done better?

The previous two sections highlight two particular aspects of the package that
could be improved:

1. There is definitely a need to incorporate calculation of distance matrices
   within the package itself, and to ensure that these matrices precisely match
   corresponding trip matrices, rather than relying on the somewhat unwieldy
   code above (via the `match_mats()` function).
2. There is likely also a need to map numbers of trips between pairs of stations
   directly onto cumulative flow densities throughout the underlying street
   network. This can be done as illustrated in the [current 
vignette](https://ropensci.github.io/bikedata/articles/bikedata.html#visualisation-of-bicycle-trips)
   using the [`stplanr` package](https://github.com/ropensci/stplanr), but could
   be made easier, and likely incorporated directed within
   [`bikedata`](https://github.com/ropensci/bikedata).
3. Building directly from these two points, there is also highly likely to be a
   need to be able to visualise trip matrices using some kind of internal 
   [`bikedata`](https://github.com/ropensci/bikedata) function.

How can you help? A great place to start, and one that would really help
improve the package, is the official [Hacktoberfest
issue](https://ropensci.org/blog/blog/2017/10/02/hacktoberfest), helping to
import the next lot of data from [San
Francisco](https://github.com/ropensci/bikedata/issues/34). See the
[contributing
guidelines](https://github.com/ropensci/bikedata/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
for general advice.

# Acknowledgements

Finally, this package wouldn't be what it is without my co-author [Richard
Ellison](https://github.com/richardellison), who greatly accelerated development
through encouraging C rather than C++ code for the SQL interfaces. [Maëlle
Salmon](https://github.com/maelle) majestically guided the entire review
process, and made the transformation of the package to its current polished form
a joy and a pleasure. I remain indebted to both [Bea
Hernández](https://github.com/chucheria) and [Elaine
McVey](https://github.com/eamcvey) for offering their time to extensively test
and [review the package](https://github.com/ropensci/onboarding/issues/116) as
part of rOpenSci's onboarding process. The review process has made the package
what it is, and for that I am grateful to all involved!
